0x02 Python - Import & Modules

This repository contains Python scripts and modules that demonstrate various concepts related to importing and using modules in Python.

Learning Objectives At the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain why Python programming is awesome
Import functions from another file
Use imported functions
Create a module
Use the built-in function dir()
Prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
Use command-line arguments with your Python programs
Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory
The code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) style guide
All files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Files The following are the tasks and their respective files:

Import a simple function from a simple file File: 0-add.py Description: This program imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.

My first toolbox! File: 1-calculation.py Description: This program imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, performs mathematical operations using the imported functions, and prints the results.

How to make a script dynamic! File: 2-args.py Description: This program prints the number of and the list of its command-line arguments.

Infinite addition File: 3-infinite_add.py Description: This program prints the result of adding all the command-line arguments.

Who are you? File: 4-hidden_discovery.py Description: This program prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.

Everything can be imported File: 5-variable_load.py Description: This program imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

Acknowledgement These tasks are part of the ALX Higher-Level Programming curriculum in the project.

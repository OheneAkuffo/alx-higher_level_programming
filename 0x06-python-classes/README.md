Python - Classes and Objects

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum and focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The project aims to familiarize learners with the fundamentals of OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, methods, encapsulation, information hiding, and more.

Learning Objectives By completing this project, you should be able to:

Understand the concept of OOP and its importance in Python programming.
Explain the difference between a class and an object or instance.
Define and use attributes, including public, protected, and private attributes.
Implement methods within a class.
Utilize the special init method for initializing objects.
Understand and apply concepts of data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.
Differentiate between attributes and properties in Python.
Write getters and setters using the property decorator.
Dynamically create attributes for existing instances of a class.
Explore the dict attribute of a class or instance.
Access and update private attributes using property methods.
Implement a class method to calculate the area of a square.
Print a square object with a specific size using the my_print method.
Define a class with a position attribute to represent the coordinates of a square.
Requirements

Python 3.8.5
pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style validation)
Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

0-square.py: Defines an empty class Square.

1-square.py: Defines a class Square with a private instance attribute size.

2-square.py: Adds validation to the size attribute in the Square class.

3-square.py: Implements a public instance method area to calculate the area of the square.

4-square.py: Adds getter and setter methods for the size attribute in the Square class.

5-square.py: Implements a my_print method to print the square with the character '#'.

6-square.py: Adds a private instance attribute position to represent the coordinates of the square.

Usage

You can run each file independently to test the functionality of the corresponding class. For example:

$ ./0-main.py
<class '0-square.Square'>
{}
Feel free to explore and test the different classes and methods implemented in the project.

Python - More Classes and Objects

This project focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python and covers various concepts related to classes, objects, attributes, methods, and more.

Requirements

All code files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
The pycodestyle tool (version 2.8.*) should be used to check the code style.
All code files must be executable.
The length of the code files will be tested using the wc command.
Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

0-rectangle.py: Defines an empty class Rectangle.

1-rectangle.py: Defines a class Rectangle with private attributes width and height and their corresponding getters and setters.

2-rectangle.py: Extends the Rectangle class with methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

3-rectangle.py: Enhances the Rectangle class with methods to print the rectangle using str() and print().

4-rectangle.py: Extends the Rectangle class with a repr() method to return a string representation of the object.

5-rectangle.py: Adds functionality to print a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.

6-README.md: Provides an overview of the project and its tasks.

Running the Code To run the code, you can use the following command:

python3 <file_name>.py
Replace <file_name> with the name of the Python file you want to execute.
Evaluation The project will be evaluated based on the implementation of the required classes and methods, adherence to the project requirements, and proper code style and formatting.

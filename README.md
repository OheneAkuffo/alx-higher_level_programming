Learn Python Repository

This repository is designed to track my progress and showcase the completed tasks as I learn Python programming. Each completed task will be represented by a Python script file that meets specific requirements outlined below.

Repository Structure

The repository has the following structure:

README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.
Directory: containing a specific topic.
task1.py: Python script file representing the completion of Task 1.
task2.py: Python script file representing the completion of Task 2.
...: Additional Python script files for each completed task. pycodestyle.ini: Configuration file for pycodestyle to maintain consistent code style.

requirements.txt: File listing the required Python packages for running the scripts.

Task Requirements

To ensure consistency and compatibility, the completed task files must adhere to the following requirements:

All files should be interpreted and compiled using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

The file extension for all scripts should be .py.

All files should end with a new line.

The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.

The code should follow the PEP 8 style guide and use the pycodestyle linter (version 2.8.x).

All files must be executable.

The length of the files will be tested using the wc command.

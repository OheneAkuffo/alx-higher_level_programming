##0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

Description In this project, I implemented a Python script using both MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to interact with a MySQL database. The project focuses on Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and covers the following tasks:

#TASK 0. Get all states Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.

Filter states Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with 'N' (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.

Filter states by user input Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where the name matches the argument.

SQL Injection... Enhance the previous script to make it safe from SQL injection.

Cities by states Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.

All cities by state Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.

First state model Write a Python script that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base().

All states via SQLAlchemy Write a script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa using SQLAlchemy.

First state Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.

Contains a Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter 'a' from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.

Get a state Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as an argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.

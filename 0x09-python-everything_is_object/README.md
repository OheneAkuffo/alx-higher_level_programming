Python - Everything is object

This project focuses on understanding the concept of objects in Python and how Python handles different types of objects. It covers topics such as mutability, immutability, references, aliases, and object identity. The project includes a series of tasks that test your understanding of these concepts.

Learning Objectives By completing this project, you will be able to:

Explain why Python programming is awesome.

Understand what an object is and the difference between a class, an object, and an instance.

Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects.

Understand references, assignments, and aliases.

Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object.

Display the variable identifier (memory address) in Python.

Identify the built-in mutable and immutable types in Python.

Understand how Python passes variables to functions.

Requirements Python scripts should be written and executed using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

The code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (use pycodestyle).

All script files should start with #!/usr/bin/python3.

The code files should be executable.

The project directory should include a README.md file.

Project Structure The project contains the following files:

0-answer.txt: Contains the name of the function used to get the type of an object. 1-answer.txt: Contains the name of the function used to get the variable identifier (memory address). 2-answer.txt: Contains the answer to whether variables a and b point to the same object. 3-answer.txt to 13-answer.txt: Contains similar questions about variable assignments and object identity. 14-answer.txt and 15-answer.txt: Contains the output of code snippets involving list operations. 16-answer.txt and 17-answer.txt: Contains the output of code snippets involving variable incrementation. 18-answer.txt: Contains the output of code snippets involving list assignments. 19-copy_list.py: Contains a function copy_list that returns a copy of a given list. 20-answer.txt to 26-answer.txt: Contains questions related to tuples and their properties. 27-answer.txt and 28-answer.txt: Contains the answer to whether the last line of code will print a specific memory address. 29-magic_string.py: Contains the implementation of the magic_string function.

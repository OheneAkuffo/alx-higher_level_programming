Description

This repository contains Python scripts and test cases for the 0x07. Python - Test-driven development project. The project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python and includes tasks related to writing tests, documentation, and implementing functions.

Learning Objectives

Understand the benefits of test-driven development
Write tests using the doctest and unittest modules
Write Docstrings and documentation for modules and functions
Handle different data types and edge cases in tests
Use basic option flags for creating tests
Project Tasks

Integers addition
Divide a matrix
Say my name
Print square
Text indentation
Max integer - Unittest

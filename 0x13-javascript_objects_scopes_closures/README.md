##Project: JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

Overview This project focuses on fundamental concepts in JavaScript, including objects, scopes, and closures. The tasks involve creating and manipulating classes, exploring inheritance, and implementing various functions to solidify your understanding of JavaScript programming.

Learning Objectives Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

Explain the significance of JavaScript programming. Create objects in JavaScript using the class notation. Understand the meaning of this in JavaScript. Grasp the concept of closures. Comprehend the role of prototypes in JavaScript. Inherit an object from another. Implement various functions and methods in JavaScript. Project Structure The project is organized into tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of JavaScript programming. The tasks include creating and manipulating classes, working with inheritance, and implementing functions to achieve specific objectives.

#Task List

Write an empty class Rectangle using the class notation. Rectangle #1

Define a class Rectangle with a constructor that takes two arguments (w and h) and initializes instance attributes. Rectangle #2

Enhance the Rectangle class from Task 2 to handle cases where width or height is 0 or not a positive integer. Rectangle #3

Add an instance method called print() to the Rectangle class that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'. Rectangle #4

Expand the Rectangle class to include methods: print(), rotate(), and double().

Create a class Square that inherits from Rectangle and defines a square. Square #1

Add an instance method charPrint(c) to the Square class that prints the square using the character c. Occurrences

Implement a function nbOccurences that returns the number of occurrences of a given element in a list. Esrever

Write a function esrever that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in reverse method. Log me

Implement a function logMe that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value. Number conversion

Write a function converter that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument. Factor index

reate a script that imports an array and computes a new array based on the index and value of the elements. Sorted occurrences

Write a script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence. Concat files

Implement a script that concatenates two files.

Requirements All files must be written in JavaScript and use the class notation for defining classes. Use the specified shebang (#!/usr/bin/node) at the beginning of each file. Ensure that all files are executable. Write a README.md file at the root of the project folder, providing an overview of the project, learning objectives, and explanations for each task.

How to Run Install Node 14: $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash - and $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs. Install semi-standard: $ sudo npm install semistandard --global. Run the scripts using node <script_name>
